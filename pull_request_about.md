# Pull Request: AboutTab Component Tests

## Description
This pull request adds comprehensive tests for the AboutTab component following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The tests ensure that the component behaves as expected and will help catch any regressions in future development.

- Implemented 4 test cases covering:
  - Rendering the component with information text
  - Verifying paragraph and formatting structure
  - Checking CSS classes for styling
  - Preparing for version information display (currently a placeholder test)
- Added data-testid attribute to the AboutTab component for better testing
- Ensured all tests pass with proper handling of text broken up by elements

## Testing Performed
- All 4 test cases pass successfully
- Verified that the tests cover the main functionality of the AboutTab component
- Added a placeholder test for version information that will guide future implementation

## Checklist
- [x] Tests have been added for the new code
