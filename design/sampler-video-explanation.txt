the purpose of this video is to

illustrate how to use code app sampler

to gener

from a model in the top menu click on

plugins and select sampler here we see a

collection of objects in a mixer that we

can edit you can imagine this mixer as a

hat with pieces of paper in it

I can add objects using the plus button

if I've added too many I can use the

minus button to remove them let's say I

want to simulate a situation of a

carnival duckpond game that has a

collection of rubber ducks in a pond

where 20% of the Ducks are marked on

their belly for a price

if a player picks one of these marked

floating ducks they win a price once the

duck is picked it is returned to the

pond and the booth operator swirls them

around in the pond to mix them up the

booth owners expect about 50 students to

play the game at the carnival

each player pays $1 to pick three Ducks

one at a time with replacement I can

create 10 objects two objects to

represent winning ducks which I will

label as prize an 8 to represent blank

ducks which I will label as no we are

using 10 objects with two labeled prize

to model the situation of having 20%

ducks labeled in the pond

if we click on spinner we can see how

the same distribution from the mixer is

represented in a spinner model these

options appear allow me to choose my

sample size in addition to how many

times I run the simulation the default

option in the sampler is that objects

are chosen with replacement if you're

modeling a scenario that includes

without replacement you can change that

under this options tab also take note of

the hide model option which might be

helpful if you are a teacher and don't

want your students to see the model you

have created I can ask myself the

question after randomly choosing three

ducks what are the chances of winning a

prize for all three I can test this out

by simulating to see about how many

prizes would be won in this scenario

first I'll simulate a round of the game

where one player picks three Ducks

so change the default five items to

three for now I will simulate playing

the game six times so I will collect six

samples and press start you will see

that an object is randomly selected

three times and that this process is

repeated six times in addition a table

automatically starts to populate with

the results of my simulation it is in

the form of a hierarchical table on the

outermost level of the table I see that

so far I've only run one experiment in

the next level I see that I have taken

six samples and in the final level I see

the results of the six samples I took

three values from the first three values

from the second and so on if I click on

sample two for example all three results

from that sample are highlighted I can

now graph the results of my simulation

by creating a graph and dragging value

to the x-axis I can also separate my

results by which sample they belong to

by dragging sample to the y-axis now I'm

going to run the simulation many more

times than to speed up the process I can

change the speed setting to fastest I'm

going to collect 44 more samples

it becomes clear to me that this graph

is not so helpful anymore but I can use

the table to calculate a measure that

may be more helpful to me if I want to

calculate how many prizes students got

and each simulated round of play I can

add an attribute at the sample level by

clicking on this plus sign I click on

the attribute to edit the formula and

count the number of times prize appears

in each sample now let's graph this new

attribute notice that I can change this

kick this attribute to be treated as

categorical and change it into a bar

graph and I notice that none of the

students got three prizes during 50

rounds of play that was a brief

introduction to one way of using the

sampler which is to generate your own

data using a model another way is to

sample data from an existing data set of

population data here I have already

opened a very large dataset of movies

which contains over 5,000 movies and

lots of information on each case or each

movie the data set is from data world's

and was compiled by scraping information

from the online movie database IMDB I'm

going to treat this data set as a

population

even though realistically it is missing

movies let's say I want to take a sample

of these movies to approximate the

average length of movies so I've opened

the sampler again and this time I'm

using the collector tool my data set is

already populated in the collector and

each case is represented by an object I

can also choose other collections here

if they are available

I want to sample 45 movies from my

population so I've changed the 5 to a 45

and I want to do this five times I've

clicked start but sometimes when

sampling from a large collection it may

take a few seconds for cases to be

sampled and for the taped table to

populate now that my five samples of 45

movies each have been taken

I can now graph movie duration and in

order to see what the distribution looks

like for each sample I can separate by

sample I can display the mean and I can

start to see the variability and the

means between samples this is a brief

introduction to how to use the sampler

to collect samples from a dataset
