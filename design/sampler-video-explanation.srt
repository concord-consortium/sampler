1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,720
the purpose of this video is to

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,760
illustrate how to use code app sampler

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,560
to gener

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,080
from a model in the top menu click on

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,020
plugins and select sampler here we see a

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,850
collection of objects in a mixer that we

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,279
can edit you can imagine this mixer as a

8
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:23,960
hat with pieces of paper in it

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,510
I can add objects using the plus button

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,000
if I've added too many I can use the

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,200
minus button to remove them let's say I

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,700
want to simulate a situation of a

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,890
carnival duckpond game that has a

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,270
collection of rubber ducks in a pond

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,640
where 20% of the Ducks are marked on

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,900
their belly for a price

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,910
if a player picks one of these marked

18
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,190
floating ducks they win a price once the

19
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,900
duck is picked it is returned to the

20
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,730
pond and the booth operator swirls them

21
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,670
around in the pond to mix them up the

22
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,620
booth owners expect about 50 students to

23
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,970
play the game at the carnival

24
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,150
each player pays $1 to pick three Ducks

25
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,729
one at a time with replacement I can

26
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,340
create 10 objects two objects to

27
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,680
represent winning ducks which I will

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:17,479
label as prize an 8 to represent blank

29
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,200
ducks which I will label as no we are

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,810
using 10 objects with two labeled prize

31
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,079
to model the situation of having 20%

32
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,759
ducks labeled in the pond

33
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,050
if we click on spinner we can see how

34
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,850
the same distribution from the mixer is

35
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,970
represented in a spinner model these

36
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,650
options appear allow me to choose my

37
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,330
sample size in addition to how many

38
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,270
times I run the simulation the default

39
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,550
option in the sampler is that objects

40
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,040
are chosen with replacement if you're

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,050
modeling a scenario that includes

42
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,150
without replacement you can change that

43
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,390
under this options tab also take note of

44
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,340
the hide model option which might be

45
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,350
helpful if you are a teacher and don't

46
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,880
want your students to see the model you

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,900
have created I can ask myself the

48
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,640
question after randomly choosing three

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,560
ducks what are the chances of winning a

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,500
prize for all three I can test this out

51
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,210
by simulating to see about how many

52
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,410
prizes would be won in this scenario

53
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,940
first I'll simulate a round of the game

54
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,740
where one player picks three Ducks

55
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,870
so change the default five items to

56
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,560
three for now I will simulate playing

57
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,510
the game six times so I will collect six

58
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,200
samples and press start you will see

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,030
that an object is randomly selected

60
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,550
three times and that this process is

61
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,630
repeated six times in addition a table

62
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,220
automatically starts to populate with

63
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,620
the results of my simulation it is in

64
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,500
the form of a hierarchical table on the

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,660
outermost level of the table I see that

66
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,760
so far I've only run one experiment in

67
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,739
the next level I see that I have taken

68
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,410
six samples and in the final level I see

69
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,850
the results of the six samples I took

70
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,430
three values from the first three values

71
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,130
from the second and so on if I click on

72
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,530
sample two for example all three results

73
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,350
from that sample are highlighted I can

74
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,180
now graph the results of my simulation

75
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,150
by creating a graph and dragging value

76
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,610
to the x-axis I can also separate my

77
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,670
results by which sample they belong to

78
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,600
by dragging sample to the y-axis now I'm

79
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,280
going to run the simulation many more

80
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,530
times than to speed up the process I can

81
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,680
change the speed setting to fastest I'm

82
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,630
going to collect 44 more samples

83
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,530
it becomes clear to me that this graph

84
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,900
is not so helpful anymore but I can use

85
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,459
the table to calculate a measure that

86
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,420
may be more helpful to me if I want to

87
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,189
calculate how many prizes students got

88
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,590
and each simulated round of play I can

89
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,989
add an attribute at the sample level by

90
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:10,669
clicking on this plus sign I click on

91
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:14,709
the attribute to edit the formula and

92
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,329
count the number of times prize appears

93
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:28,699
in each sample now let's graph this new

94
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:37,340
attribute notice that I can change this

95
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,949
kick this attribute to be treated as

96
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:45,199
categorical and change it into a bar

97
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,110
graph and I notice that none of the

98
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,150
students got three prizes during 50

99
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,330
rounds of play that was a brief

100
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,949
introduction to one way of using the

101
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,479
sampler which is to generate your own

102
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:02,180
data using a model another way is to

103
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,250
sample data from an existing data set of

104
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,680
population data here I have already

105
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,659
opened a very large dataset of movies

106
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:12,159
which contains over 5,000 movies and

107
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,530
lots of information on each case or each

108
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,280
movie the data set is from data world's

109
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,289
and was compiled by scraping information

110
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,900
from the online movie database IMDB I'm

111
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,669
going to treat this data set as a

112
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:26,360
population

113
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,460
even though realistically it is missing

114
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,130
movies let's say I want to take a sample

115
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,320
of these movies to approximate the

116
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,440
average length of movies so I've opened

117
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,560
the sampler again and this time I'm

118
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,919
using the collector tool my data set is

119
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,630
already populated in the collector and

120
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,940
each case is represented by an object I

121
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,690
can also choose other collections here

122
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,800
if they are available

123
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,830
I want to sample 45 movies from my

124
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,279
population so I've changed the 5 to a 45

125
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,979
and I want to do this five times I've

126
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,689
clicked start but sometimes when

127
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,909
sampling from a large collection it may

128
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,829
take a few seconds for cases to be

129
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,439
sampled and for the taped table to

130
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:20,419
populate now that my five samples of 45

131
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:22,699
movies each have been taken

132
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:32,989
I can now graph movie duration and in

133
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:35,029
order to see what the distribution looks

134
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,299
like for each sample I can separate by

135
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:42,739
sample I can display the mean and I can

136
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,229
start to see the variability and the

137
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:50,149
means between samples this is a brief

138
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:52,759
introduction to how to use the sampler

139
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,059
to collect samples from a dataset
