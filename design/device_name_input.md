# Device Name Input Enhancement Design Document

## Problem Statement
The current device name input functionality lacks several user experience features that would make it more intuitive and user-friendly. Specifically, the input field does not automatically resize based on content, lacks validation for name uniqueness, and does not provide visual feedback during editing.

## Requirements

1. **Input Resizing**
   - The input field should automatically resize based on the content length
   - Minimum and maximum width constraints should be applied
   - Resizing should be smooth and responsive

2. **Name Validation**
   - Validate that device names are unique within the model
   - Provide visual feedback for invalid names
   - Prevent submission of invalid names

3. **Auto-Focus**
   - Automatically focus the input field when editing begins
   - Select all text when the field is focused for easy replacement

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Provide clear visual indication when the field is in edit mode
   - Show a subtle animation when transitioning between view and edit modes

## Design Approach

### Component Structure
We will enhance the existing `NameLabelInput` component to include the new functionality. The component will:

1. Use a ref to measure and adjust the input width based on content
2. Implement validation logic to check for name uniqueness
3. Add auto-focus and text selection behavior
4. Include visual feedback through CSS transitions and states

### Implementation Details

#### Input Resizing
- Use a hidden span element to measure the text width
- Apply the measured width to the input field with padding
- Set minimum and maximum width constraints
- Update width on each keystroke

#### Name Validation
- Check against existing device names in the global state
- Apply error styling for duplicate names
- Disable submission (Enter key and blur events) for invalid names
- Show tooltip with error message

#### Auto-Focus
- Use `useEffect` to focus the input when it mounts
- Use `select()` method to select all text
- Maintain focus until a valid submission or explicit cancellation

#### Visual Feedback
- Add transition effects for smooth appearance/disappearance
- Use a subtle border animation to indicate edit mode
- Apply different styles for valid vs. invalid states

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test input resizing with various text lengths
   - Test validation with unique and duplicate names
   - Test auto-focus and selection behavior
   - Test submission with valid and invalid inputs

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interaction with the Device component
   - Test persistence of edited names in the global state
   - Test behavior when multiple devices are present

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Verify smooth resizing behavior
   - Check visual feedback clarity
   - Test keyboard navigation and submission
   - Verify focus behavior in different scenarios

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a new test file for the enhanced input functionality
2. Implement the core resizing logic
3. Add validation functionality
4. Enhance focus and selection behavior
5. Add visual feedback styles
6. Update the Device component to use the enhanced input
7. Run tests and fix any issues
8. Manually verify the implementation

## Mockups

```
Normal state:
┌─────────────┐
│ Device Name │
└─────────────┘

Editing state (auto-sized):
┌───────────────────┐
│ Longer Device Name│
└───────────────────┘

Error state:
┌───────────────────┐
│ Duplicate Name    │ ⚠️
└───────────────────┘
```

## Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Provide appropriate ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Add descriptive error messages for validation failures
