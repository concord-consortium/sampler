# Sampler App Test Coverage Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to achieving comprehensive test coverage for the Sampler application. Based on the current coverage analysis (52.75% statements, 36.6% branches, 43.63% functions, 52.19% lines), we need a strategic plan to reach our target of 100% coverage.

## Goals

1. Increase overall test coverage to 100% for critical paths
2. Ensure all user-facing features have comprehensive tests
3. Implement proper integration tests for CODAP interactions
4. Develop robust end-to-end tests for critical user flows
5. Establish a sustainable testing strategy for future development

## Progress Tracking

| Phase | Target Completion | Actual Completion | Coverage Achieved |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Phase 1 | Week 2 | | |
| Phase 2 | Week 4 | | |
| Phase 3 | Week 6 | | |

## Best Practices

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Write tests before implementing new features
   - Ensure tests fail before implementation
   - Refactor after tests pass

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run tests on every commit
   - Maintain coverage thresholds
   - Address failing tests immediately

3. **Test Organization**
   - Group tests logically
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Maintain test independence

4. **Code Quality**
   - Keep tests simple and focused
   - Avoid test duplication
   - Use proper mocking and stubbing

## Conclusion

This test coverage plan provides a systematic approach to achieving comprehensive test coverage for the Sampler application. By following this plan, we can ensure that all components and features are thoroughly tested, resulting in a more robust and reliable application.

Progress will be tracked in this document, with regular updates to reflect completed tasks and achieved coverage metrics.
