# Lock Model with Password Feature

## Problem Statement
Users need the ability to lock the model with a password to prevent unauthorized changes while still allowing the model to be viewed. This enhances the security of the sampler model beyond just hiding it, ensuring that only authorized users can modify the configuration.

## Requirements

1. **Password Protection**
   - Allow users to set a password to lock the model
   - Prevent model modifications when locked
   - Allow viewing the model in a locked state
   - Require password to unlock the model

2. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear visual indication of locked state
   - Offer intuitive UI for setting/entering passwords
   - Include password confirmation to prevent typos
   - Support password reset functionality

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Store password securely (not in plain text)
   - Implement basic validation for password strength
   - Prevent brute force attempts with rate limiting
   - Provide fallback recovery options

4. **Integration with Existing Features**
   - Work alongside the Hide Model functionality
   - Maintain state across page refreshes
   - Preserve CODAP integration

## Technical Design

### State Management
We'll extend the global state to include:
```typescript
interface IGlobalState {
  // ... existing properties
  isModelLocked: boolean;
  hasPassword: boolean;
  // We don't store the actual password in the state
}
```

### Password Storage
For security, we'll use a hashed version of the password:
- Use a cryptographic hash function (SHA-256)
- Store the hash in localStorage with a unique key
- Include a salt to prevent rainbow table attacks

### Component Structure

1. **LockModelButton Component**
   - Toggle button in the model header
   - Shows lock/unlock icon based on state
   - Opens password modal when clicked

2. **PasswordModal Component**
   - Different modes: set, enter, change password
   - Password input with confirmation
   - Validation feedback
   - Success/error messaging

3. **UI Modifications**
   - Visual indicators for locked state
   - Disabled controls when locked
   - Info tooltips explaining locked state

### User Flows

1. **Setting a Password**
   - User clicks "Lock Model" button
   - Modal appears to set password
   - User enters and confirms password
   - System validates and stores password hash
   - UI updates to show locked state

2. **Unlocking the Model**
   - User clicks "Unlock Model" button
   - Modal appears to enter password
   - User enters password
   - System validates password
   - If correct, model unlocks and UI updates

3. **Changing Password**
   - User must first unlock the model
   - Option to change password appears
   - User enters current password and new password
   - System validates and updates password hash

4. **Forgotten Password**
   - Provide option to reset password
   - Implement appropriate verification method
   - Clear existing password and allow setting new one

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
1. **LockModelButton Component**
   - Test rendering in different states
   - Test click handlers
   - Test accessibility features

2. **PasswordModal Component**
   - Test rendering in different modes
   - Test password validation
   - Test form submission
   - Test error handling

3. **Password Utilities**
   - Test password hashing
   - Test password validation
   - Test storage mechanisms

### Integration Tests
1. **Lock/Unlock Flow**
   - Test complete lock/unlock workflow
   - Test persistence across refreshes
   - Test interaction with other features

2. **Security Tests**
   - Test against common password attacks
   - Test storage security
   - Test input sanitization

### Accessibility Tests
1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Test modal focus management
   - Test keyboard shortcuts

2. **Screen Reader Compatibility**
   - Test ARIA attributes
   - Test meaningful labels and instructions

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Password Functionality**
   - Implement password utilities (hashing, validation)
   - Create basic UI components
   - Add state management

2. **Phase 2: UI Refinement**
   - Enhance visual indicators
   - Improve form validation
   - Add animations and transitions

3. **Phase 3: Security Enhancements**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add password strength meter
   - Enhance storage security

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement**
   - Conduct comprehensive testing
   - Address edge cases
   - Optimize performance

## Potential Challenges

1. **Security Considerations**
   - Client-side security has inherent limitations
   - Need to balance security with usability

2. **User Experience**
   - Password recovery in a client-side application
   - Clear communication of locked state

3. **Integration**
   - Interaction with CODAP's state management
   - Persistence across sessions

## Success Criteria

1. Users can successfully lock and unlock the model with a password
2. The locked state persists across page refreshes
3. The UI clearly indicates when the model is locked
4. All tests pass with good coverage
5. The feature meets accessibility standards
