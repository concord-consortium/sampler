# Spinner Animation Feature Design Document

## 1. Problem Statement

The current Spinner device in the Sampler tool lacks smooth and visually appealing animation during the sampling process. When a user runs a simulation, the spinner should rotate realistically and provide clear visual feedback about the selection process. This feature will enhance the user experience and make the sampling process more engaging and educational.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Smooth Rotation Animation**
   - The spinner should rotate smoothly when a sample is being collected
   - The rotation speed should be consistent with the global animation speed setting
   - The rotation should appear natural and physics-based (start slow, accelerate, then decelerate)

2. **Needle Selection Visualization**
   - The needle should clearly indicate which wedge is selected
   - The final position of the needle should accurately reflect the random selection
   - The needle should have a subtle "bounce" effect when it stops on a wedge

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - The selected wedge should be highlighted during and after selection
   - The selection should be visually connected to the output display
   - Animation should be skipped in "Fastest" speed mode but still show the final result

4. **Integration with Animation System**
   - The spinner animation should integrate with the existing animation system
   - The animation should respect pause/resume controls
   - The animation should work correctly with the "Repeat Until" condition feature

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - The animation should run smoothly without causing performance issues
   - The animation should work well even with many wedges

2. **Accessibility**
   - The animation should respect user preferences for reduced motion
   - The selection should be clear even without animation

3. **Compatibility**
   - The animation should work consistently across different browsers
   - The animation should work in both CODAP v2 and v3

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Animation Flow

The spinner animation will follow these steps:

1. **Initialization**
   - Calculate the target wedge based on the random selection
   - Determine the target angle for the needle to point to the selected wedge
   - Calculate the rotation parameters (duration, easing, etc.)

2. **Rotation Animation**
   - Start with a slow initial velocity
   - Accelerate to a peak velocity
   - Decelerate as the needle approaches the target angle
   - Apply a small "overshoot" followed by a "bounce back" to the final position

3. **Selection Finalization**
   - Highlight the selected wedge
   - Trigger any callbacks for the selection
   - Update the output display

### 3.2 Technical Approach

We will implement the animation using the following approach:

1. **Animation Controller**
   - Extend the existing animation controller to handle spinner-specific animations
   - Add spinner rotation as a new animation step type
   - Implement timing and easing functions for natural motion

2. **Needle Component**
   - Enhance the Needle component to support smooth rotation
   - Use CSS transforms for performance
   - Implement the "bounce" effect at the end of rotation

3. **Wedge Component**
   - Add visual feedback for selection
   - Implement highlight effects for the selected wedge

4. **Integration Points**
   - Connect the spinner animation to the global animation system
   - Ensure proper sequencing with other animation steps
   - Handle edge cases like pausing during animation
