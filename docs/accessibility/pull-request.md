# Pull Request: Improve WCAG Meaningful Sequence Compliance

## Overview
This PR addresses accessibility issues related to WCAG 1.3.2 (Meaningful Sequence) by improving the reading order, heading hierarchy, and dynamic content handling in several components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Heading Hierarchy in Measures Component
- Updated heading levels in `measures.tsx` to ensure proper hierarchy (h2 before h3)
- Ensures that screen readers can properly navigate the document structure

### 2. Improved Dynamic Content Accessibility in Device Component
- Added proper ARIA attributes to the device container and interactive elements
- Enhanced screen reader descriptions with more context
- Improved the association between labels and elements using `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`
- Added proper roles to interactive elements

### 3. Enhanced Modal Dialog Accessibility
- Updated `SetVariableSeriesModal` component to support ARIA attributes
- Added proper dialog role and modal attributes
- Improved form controls with proper labels and descriptions
- Enhanced keyboard accessibility for modal interactions

### 4. Improved Dynamic Content Handling in Outputs Component
- Added ARIA live regions to dynamically updating content
- Improved labeling of variable outputs
- Enhanced screen reader announcements for changing content

### 5. Added Comprehensive Testing
- Created `meaningful-sequence.test.tsx` to verify reading order compliance
- Added tests for heading hierarchy
- Added tests for proper DOM order matching visual order
- Implemented tests for dynamic content updates

## Testing
The changes have been tested with:
- Jest unit tests for accessibility compliance
- axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- Manual verification of reading order and heading hierarchy

## Impact
These changes significantly improve the application's compliance with WCAG 1.3.2 (Meaningful Sequence) by ensuring that:
1. Content is presented in a meaningful order to all users
2. Screen readers can navigate the content in a logical sequence
3. Dynamic content updates are properly announced
4. Heading hierarchy follows proper structure

## Next Steps
After this PR is merged, we should:
1. Continue addressing the remaining partially covered WCAG criteria
2. Implement similar improvements for Focus Order (WCAG 2.4.3)
3. Enhance the test suite for other accessibility requirements
