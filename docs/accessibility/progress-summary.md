## Current Work in Progress

### 1. Focus Management (WCAG 2.4.3 and 2.4.7)
- Implementing comprehensive focus order tests
- Enhancing focus visibility across all interactive elements
- Improving focus management during dynamic content changes

### 2. Error Identification (WCAG 3.3.1)
- Enhancing form validation and error messaging
- Improving accessibility of error messages
- Testing error state styling and contrast

## Planned Future Work

### 1. Resize Text and Reflow (WCAG 1.4.4 and 1.4.10)
- Implementing tests for text resizing up to 200%
- Verifying layout integrity at larger text sizes
- Testing responsive behavior across different screen sizes

### 2. Predictable Web Pages (WCAG 3.2)
- Ensuring consistent navigation
- Verifying that context changes are user-initiated
- Testing for unexpected focus changes

### 3. Additional WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria
- **1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics**: Ensuring instructions don't rely solely on sensory characteristics
- **1.3.4 Orientation**: Ensuring content is not restricted to specific orientation
- **1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose**: Adding appropriate purpose identification to input fields
- **1.4.5 Images of Text**: Using text rather than images of text
- **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast**: Ensuring UI components have sufficient contrast
- **1.4.12 Text Spacing**: Verifying no loss of content when text spacing is adjusted
- **1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus**: Making additional content on hover/focus dismissible
- **2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts**: Allowing shortcuts to be turned off or remapped
- **2.4.5 Multiple Ways**: Providing multiple ways to locate a page
- **2.4.6 Headings and Labels**: Ensuring headings and labels describe topic or purpose
- **2.5.1-2.5.4 Input Modalities**: Addressing pointer gestures, cancellation, labels, and motion actuation
- **3.1.2 Language of Parts**: Making language of parts programmatically determinable
- **3.2.1-3.2.4 Predictable**: Ensuring predictable operation and consistent navigation
- **3.3.2-3.3.4 Input Assistance**: Providing labels, error suggestions, and error prevention
- **4.1.3 Status Messages**: Making status messages programmatically determinable

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- Testing with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
- Testing with speech recognition software
- Testing with screen magnifiers
- User testing with individuals who rely on assistive technologies

### 5. Documentation and Training
- Completing accessibility testing guidelines
- Training team members on accessibility best practices
- Integrating accessibility testing into CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

We have made significant progress in implementing accessibility features in the Sampler application, particularly in the areas of meaningful sequence, time-based media, and seizure prevention. Our current focus is on improving focus management and error identification, with plans to address resize text, reflow, and predictable web pages in the near future.

By continuing to prioritize accessibility in our development process, we aim to create an application that is usable and accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or the assistive technologies they use.
