# Accessibility Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our plan for implementing comprehensive accessibility tests to address the gaps identified in our WCAG compliance audit.

## Test Development Approach

We will follow these principles when developing our accessibility tests:

1. **Component-level testing**: Test individual components for accessibility compliance
2. **Integration testing**: Test interactions between components
3. **User flow testing**: Test complete user journeys
4. **Automated verification**: Use automated tools where possible
5. **Manual verification**: Supplement with manual testing for areas that can't be fully automated

## Test Suites to Implement

Based on our audit, we will implement the following test suites:

### 1. Meaningful Sequence Tests

**File**: `src/test/meaningful-sequence.test.tsx`

**Tests to implement:**
- DOM order matches visual order
- Reading order is logical for screen readers
- Dynamic content maintains reading sequence
- Tab order follows a logical sequence

### 2. Resize Text Tests

**File**: `src/test/resize-text.test.tsx`

**Tests to implement:**
- UI remains usable with text at 200%
- No text truncation or overflow at larger sizes
- Layout integrity is maintained at different text sizes
- Text containers expand appropriately

### 3. Focus Order Tests

**File**: `src/test/focus-order.test.tsx`

**Tests to implement:**
- Focus follows a logical sequence
- Modal dialogs trap and manage focus correctly
- Focus is restored after dynamic content changes
- Focus management during animations

### 4. Focus Visible Tests

**File**: `src/test/focus-visible.test.tsx`

**Tests to implement:**
- All interactive elements have visible focus indicators
- Focus indicators have sufficient contrast
- Focus visibility in different color schemes
- Focus indicators meet minimum size requirements

### 5. Error Identification Tests

**File**: `src/test/error-identification.test.tsx`

**Tests to implement:**
- Form errors are properly identified and communicated
- Error messages are associated with form fields
- Error states have appropriate styling and contrast
- Screen readers announce errors correctly

## Test Utilities

We will create the following utility files to support our tests:

### 1. Accessibility Test Helpers

**File**: `src/test/a11y-test-helpers.ts`

**Functions to implement:**
- `getFocusableElements(container)`: Get all focusable elements in a container
- `simulateTabNavigation(container)`: Simulate tabbing through elements
- `getContrastRatio(color1, color2)`: Calculate contrast ratio between colors
- `verifyReadingOrder(container)`: Verify logical reading order

### 2. Visual Testing Utilities

**File**: `src/test/visual-test-helpers.ts`

**Functions to implement:**
- `simulateTextResize(size)`: Simulate text resizing
- `captureElementScreenshot(element)`: Capture screenshot of an element
- `compareScreenshots(screenshot1, screenshot2)`: Compare two screenshots

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Create test utilities and helpers
2. **Week 2**: Implement Meaningful Sequence and Focus Order tests (High priority)
3. **Week 3**: Implement Focus Visible and Resize Text tests (Medium priority)
4. **Week 4**: Implement Error Identification tests (Medium priority)

## Integration with CI/CD

We will integrate these tests into our CI/CD pipeline to ensure ongoing compliance:

1. Run accessibility tests as part of the test suite
2. Generate accessibility reports
3. Fail the build on critical accessibility issues

## Reporting

We will generate the following reports:

1. Test coverage report for accessibility tests
2. WCAG compliance report
3. Accessibility issue tracker
