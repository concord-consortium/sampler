# WCAG Compliance Audit

## Overview
This document outlines the results of our WCAG 2.1 compliance audit, focusing on areas that are currently partially covered in our application.

## Audit Methodology
- Manual testing of key user flows
- Automated testing with Jest and Testing Library
- Code review for accessibility patterns
- Comparison against WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria

## Partially Covered Areas

### 1. Meaningful Sequence (WCAG 1.3.2)

**Current Implementation:**
- Basic keyboard navigation tests exist
- DOM structure generally follows a logical order

**Gaps Identified:**
- No explicit tests for reading order with screen readers
- Tab order is not systematically verified across the application
- Dynamic content updates may disrupt reading sequence
- No verification that the visual order matches the DOM order

**Priority:** High

### 2. Resize Text (WCAG 1.4.4)

**Current Implementation:**
- Some responsive design tests exist
- Most text uses relative units (rem/em)

**Gaps Identified:**
- No explicit tests for text resizing up to 200%
- No verification that text doesn't get cut off when enlarged
- Layout integrity at larger text sizes is not tested
- No tests for text overflow or truncation behavior

**Priority:** Medium

### 3. Focus Order (WCAG 2.4.3)

**Current Implementation:**
- Basic keyboard navigation tests exist
- Tab order follows DOM structure in most cases

**Gaps Identified:**
- No comprehensive tests for focus order across the entire application
- Modal dialogs may not properly manage focus
- Focus restoration after dynamic content changes is not verified
- No tests for focus management during animations

**Priority:** High

### 4. Focus Visible (WCAG 2.4.7)

**Current Implementation:**
- Default browser focus styles are generally preserved
- Some custom focus styles exist

**Gaps Identified:**
- No systematic testing of focus visibility across all interactive elements
- Custom focus styles may not have sufficient contrast
- Focus visibility in different color schemes is not tested
- No verification that focus indicators meet minimum size requirements

**Priority:** Medium

### 5. Error Identification (WCAG 3.3.1)

**Current Implementation:**
- Basic form validation exists
- Error messages are generally associated with form fields

**Gaps Identified:**
- Limited testing of error messages for all form fields
- Accessibility of error messages is not systematically verified
- No tests for error state styling and contrast
- Screen reader announcement of errors is not tested

**Priority:** Medium

## Next Steps

Based on this audit, we will:

1. Develop dedicated test suites for each partially covered criterion
2. Prioritize implementation based on the identified gaps
3. Create a roadmap for addressing all issues
4. Integrate accessibility testing into our CI/CD pipeline
