# WCAG Compliance Audit

## Overview
This document outlines the results of our WCAG 2.1 compliance audit, focusing on areas that are currently partially covered in our application. Last updated: March 11, 2025.

## Audit Methodology
- Manual testing of key user flows
- Automated testing with Jest and Testing Library
- Code review for accessibility patterns
- Comparison against WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria

## Completed Areas

### 1. Meaningful Sequence (WCAG 1.3.2)

**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive tests for reading order with screen readers
- Tab order is systematically verified across key components
- Dynamic content updates maintain reading sequence
- Visual order matches the DOM order in critical components
- Heading hierarchy follows proper nesting (h1 > h2 > h3)

**Status:** Complete

### 2. Time-based Media (WCAG 1.2)

**Implementation:**
- Alternatives provided for all time-based media
- Captions and transcripts available where needed
- Audio descriptions implemented where required

**Status:** Complete

### 3. Seizures and Physical Reactions (WCAG 2.3)

**Implementation:**
- No content flashes more than three times per second
- Animation speed controls implemented
- Option to disable animations entirely
- Tests verify compliance with flashing content guidelines

**Status:** Complete

## Partially Covered Areas

### 1. Focus Order (WCAG 2.4.3)

**Current Implementation:**
- Basic keyboard navigation tests exist
- Tab order follows DOM structure in most cases
- Focus trapping implemented in modals

**Gaps Identified:**
- No comprehensive tests for focus order across the entire application
- Focus restoration after dynamic content changes is not verified
- No tests for focus management during animations

**Priority:** High

### 2. Focus Visible (WCAG 2.4.7)

**Current Implementation:**
- Default browser focus styles are generally preserved
- Some custom focus styles exist

**Gaps Identified:**
- No systematic testing of focus visibility across all interactive elements
- Custom focus styles may not have sufficient contrast
- Focus visibility in different color schemes is not tested
- No verification that focus indicators meet minimum size requirements

**Priority:** Medium

### 3. Resize Text (WCAG 1.4.4)

**Current Implementation:**
- Some responsive design tests exist
- Most text uses relative units (rem/em)

**Gaps Identified:**
- No explicit tests for text resizing up to 200%
- No verification that text doesn't get cut off when enlarged
- Layout integrity at larger text sizes is not tested
- No tests for text overflow or truncation behavior

**Priority:** Medium

### 4. Error Identification (WCAG 3.3.1)

**Current Implementation:**
- Basic form validation exists
- Error messages are generally associated with form fields

**Gaps Identified:**
- Limited testing of error messages for all form fields
- Accessibility of error messages is not systematically verified
- No tests for error state styling and contrast
- Screen reader announcement of errors is not tested

**Priority:** Medium

### 5. Predictable Web Pages (WCAG 3.2)

**Current Implementation:**
- Navigation is generally consistent
- Context changes are mostly user-initiated

**Gaps Identified:**
- No systematic testing for unexpected focus changes
- No verification that input changes don't automatically change context
- Consistency of navigation and component identification not fully tested

**Priority:** Medium

## Next Steps

Based on this audit, we will:

1. Focus on implementing the remaining high-priority items:
   - Complete focus management implementation (WCAG 2.4.3 and 2.4.7)
   - Finalize input assistance and error identification (WCAG 3.3)

2. Then address medium-priority items:
   - Complete resize text and reflow testing (WCAG 1.4.4 and 1.4.10)
   - Ensure predictable web pages (WCAG 3.2)

3. Conduct comprehensive testing with assistive technologies

4. Complete documentation and training for the team
