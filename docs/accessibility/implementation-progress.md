# Accessibility Test Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of implementing accessibility tests to address the gaps identified in the WCAG compliance audit. The implementation follows the test plan outlined in `docs/accessibility/test-plan.md`.

## Test Utilities

| Utility | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `a11y-test-helpers.ts` | ✅ Completed | Provides helper functions for accessibility testing, including focus management, contrast calculation, and reading order verification. |
| `visual-test-helpers.ts` | ✅ Completed | Provides utilities for visual testing, including text resizing, overflow detection, and layout integrity checks. |

## Test Suites

### 1. Meaningful Sequence Tests (WCAG 1.3.2)

| Test Category | Status | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| DOM Order Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for proper heading hierarchy and list structure. |
| Reading Order Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for logical reading order and content sequence. |
| Tab Order Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for logical tab navigation sequence. |

### 2. Resize Text Tests (WCAG 1.4.4)

| Test Category | Status | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Text Resizing Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for text resizing up to 200% without horizontal scrolling. |
| Text Overflow Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for text truncation and overflow when resized. |
| Layout Integrity Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for maintaining layout integrity at different text sizes. |

### 3. Focus Order Tests (WCAG 2.4.3)

| Test Category | Status | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Sequential Focus Order Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for logical focus sequence following DOM and visual order. |
| Modal Dialog Focus Management Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for proper focus trapping within modal dialogs. |
| Focus Restoration Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for focus restoration after dynamic content changes. |

### 4. Focus Visible Tests (WCAG 2.4.7)

| Test Category | Status | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Focus Indicator Presence Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for visible focus indicators on interactive elements. |
| Focus Indicator Contrast Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for sufficient contrast of focus indicators. |
| Focus Indicator Size Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for sufficient size of focus indicators. |

### 5. Error Identification Tests (WCAG 3.3.1)

| Test Category | Status | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Error Message Presence Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for specific error messages for invalid form fields. |
| Error Association Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for proper association between error messages and form fields. |
| Error Styling Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for visually distinct error messages. |
| Screen Reader Announcement Tests | ✅ Completed & Passing | Tests for proper screen reader announcements of errors. |

## Test Results

All test suites have been successfully implemented and are passing. The tests provide a comprehensive framework for verifying compliance with the WCAG criteria that were previously identified as partially covered.

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Application Components**:
   - Apply these test patterns to actual application components
   - Create component-specific test cases using these utilities

2. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Add accessibility tests to the CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure reporting for accessibility test results

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update developer documentation with accessibility testing guidelines
   - Create examples of how to use the test utilities

4. **Training**:
   - Conduct training sessions for developers on accessibility testing
   - Share best practices for writing accessible code

## Conclusion

All planned test utilities and test suites have been successfully implemented and are passing. These tests provide a comprehensive framework for verifying compliance with the WCAG criteria that were previously identified as partially covered. The next phase will involve integrating these tests with actual application components and the CI/CD pipeline.
