## Introduction

Accessibility is a critical aspect of our application, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can effectively use our software. This document provides guidelines for implementing and maintaining accessibility features in the Sampler project.

## Testing Approach

We use a combination of automated and manual testing to ensure accessibility compliance:

### Automated Testing

- **Jest-axe**: Integrated with our Jest testing framework to catch accessibility issues during unit testing
- **Lighthouse**: Used for overall accessibility scoring during development and CI/CD
- **Accessibility Audit Script**: Custom script that generates comprehensive reports of accessibility violations

### Manual Testing

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Test all interactive elements for keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Use NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver to test screen reader compatibility
- **Color Contrast**: Check all text and UI elements for sufficient contrast
- **Zoom Testing**: Ensure the application works at 200% zoom

## Key WCAG 2.0 AA Requirements

### 1. Perceivable Information

- **Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for non-text content
  - All images must have appropriate alt text
  - SVG elements must have accessible names and descriptions

- **Time-based Media**: Provide alternatives for time-based media
  - Animations must have alternative representations or be able to be paused

- **Adaptable Content**: Create content that can be presented in different ways
  - Use semantic HTML elements (headings, lists, etc.)
  - Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)

- **Distinguishable Content**: Make it easier for users to see and hear content
  - Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text
  - Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 for large text
  - Do not use color alone to convey information

### 2. Operable User Interface

- **Keyboard Accessible**: Make all functionality available from a keyboard
  - All interactive elements must be focusable and operable with keyboard
  - Focus order must be logical and intuitive
  - Provide visible focus indicators

- **Enough Time**: Provide users enough time to read and use content
  - Allow users to pause, stop, or extend time limits

- **Seizures**: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures
  - Avoid flashing content that flashes more than 3 times per second

- **Navigable**: Provide ways to help users navigate and find content
  - Use descriptive page titles and headings
  - Provide skip links for navigation
  - Ensure focus is visible and clear

### 3. Understandable Information

- **Readable**: Make text content readable and understandable
  - Use clear and simple language
  - Identify the language of the page

- **Predictable**: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
  - Consistent navigation and identification
  - No unexpected changes of context

- **Input Assistance**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes
  - Provide clear labels for form elements
  - Provide error identification and suggestions
  - Provide confirmation for important actions

### 4. Robust Content

- **Compatible**: Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools
  - Use valid HTML
  - Ensure proper ARIA usage
  - Ensure name, role, and value are available for all UI components

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### Device Component

- Ensure all interactive elements have proper ARIA roles
- Provide keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text and UI elements
- Provide text alternatives for all visual elements

### Help Modal

- Ensure modal is properly announced to screen readers
- Trap focus within the modal when open
- Provide keyboard shortcuts to close the modal
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy within the modal

### Form Controls

- Provide clear labels for all form elements
- Ensure error messages are properly associated with form elements
- Provide clear instructions for form completion
- Ensure form controls have sufficient size for touch interaction

## Development Workflow

1. **Design Phase**:
   - Consider accessibility from the beginning of design
   - Use accessible color schemes and typography
   - Design for keyboard navigation

2. **Development Phase**:
   - Write accessible HTML with proper semantic elements
   - Implement keyboard navigation and focus management
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes

3. **Testing Phase**:
   - Run automated accessibility tests
   - Perform manual accessibility testing
   - Test with assistive technologies

4. **Maintenance Phase**:
   - Regularly audit for accessibility issues
   - Address accessibility bugs with high priority
   - Stay updated on accessibility best practices
