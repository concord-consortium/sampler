# Accessibility Implementation Plan for Sampler

This document outlines our plan for implementing accessibility features in the Sampler application to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Current Status (Updated March 11, 2025)

We have successfully implemented the following accessibility features:

1. Basic HTML accessibility audit script (`src/test/a11y-audit.ts`)
2. Component-specific accessibility tests using jest-axe
   - HelpModal component (`src/components/model/help-modal.a11y.test.tsx`)
   - Device component (`src/components/model/device.a11y.test.tsx`)
   - RepeatUntil component (`src/components/model/repeat-until.a11y.test.tsx`)
3. Color contrast testing utilities (`src/test/color-contrast-checker.ts`)
4. Keyboard accessibility testing utilities (`src/test/keyboard-accessibility.ts`)
5. Screen reader accessibility testing utilities (`src/test/screen-reader-utils.ts`)
6. Skip navigation testing (`src/test/skip-nav.test.tsx`)
7. Animation control testing (`src/test/animation-control.test.tsx`)
8. Meaningful sequence testing (`src/test/meaningful-sequence.test.tsx`)
9. Time-based media alternatives
10. Prevention of seizures and physical reactions
11. Enhanced animation controls

   - Test with speech recognition software
   - Test with screen magnifiers
   - Document findings and make necessary adjustments

6. **Component-Specific Accessibility Tests**

## Testing Strategy

1. **Automated Testing**: Use jest-axe for component-level accessibility testing
2. **Manual Testing**: Perform keyboard navigation and screen reader testing
3. **Visual Inspection**: Check for color contrast and visual accessibility issues
4. **User Testing**: Conduct testing with users who rely on assistive technologies
5. **Responsive Testing**: Test accessibility across different screen sizes and devices
