# Accessibility Implementation Plan for Sampler

This document outlines our plan for implementing accessibility features in the Sampler application to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.0 AA standards.

## Current Status

We have successfully set up the following accessibility testing infrastructure:

1. Basic HTML accessibility audit script (`src/test/a11y-audit.ts`)
2. Component-specific accessibility tests using jest-axe
   - HelpModal component (`src/components/model/help-modal.a11y.test.tsx`)
   - Device component (`src/components/model/device.a11y.test.tsx`)
   - RepeatUntil component (`src/components/model/repeat-until.a11y.test.tsx`)
3. Color contrast testing utilities (`src/test/color-contrast-checker.ts`)
4. Keyboard accessibility testing utilities (`src/test/keyboard-accessibility.ts`)
5. Screen reader accessibility testing utilities (`src/test/screen-reader-utils.ts`)

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Infrastructure and Audit (Completed)

- [x] Set up accessibility testing tools (jest-axe)
- [x] Create basic HTML accessibility audit
- [x] Create component-specific accessibility tests
- [x] Fix HTML language attribute in index.html
- [x] Document accessibility issues found

### Phase 2: Critical Component Remediation (Completed)

- [x] Implement focus trapping in ConditionHelpModal
- [x] Add ARIA attributes to RepeatUntil component
- [x] Add screen reader text for better context
- [x] Ensure proper keyboard navigation in modals
- [x] Fix color contrast issues in RepeatUntil component
- [x] Fix color contrast issues in Device component
- [x] Create color contrast testing utilities
- [x] Create keyboard accessibility testing utilities
- [x] Implement keyboard event handlers for RepeatUntil component
- [x] Implement keyboard event handlers for HelpModal component
- [x] Ensure all interactive elements are accessible in Device component
- [x] Implement keyboard event handlers for Device component
- [x] Implement keyboard event handlers for DeviceFooter component
- [x] Add ARIA attributes to Device and DeviceFooter components

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Implementation (In Progress)

- [x] Implement screen reader support for RepeatUntil component
- [x] Implement screen reader support for HelpModal component
- [x] Implement screen reader support for Device component
- [x] Create screen reader testing utilities
- [ ] Add skip navigation links
- [ ] Ensure all images have appropriate alt text
- [ ] Implement responsive design for various devices
- [ ] Test with assistive technologies

### Phase 4: Documentation and Training

- [x] Create accessibility implementation plan
- [ ] Establish accessibility testing guidelines
- [ ] Train team members on accessibility best practices
- [ ] Integrate accessibility testing into CI/CD pipeline

## WCAG 2.0 AA Compliance Checklist

### Perceivable

- [x] 1.1 Text Alternatives: Provide text alternatives for non-text content (added aria-label and aria-describedby)
- [ ] 1.2 Time-based Media: Provide alternatives for time-based media
- [x] 1.3 Adaptable: Create content that can be presented in different ways
- [x] 1.4 Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content (improved color contrast)

### Operable

- [x] 2.1 Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard (for all critical components)
- [ ] 2.2 Enough Time: Provide users enough time to read and use content
- [ ] 2.3 Seizures: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures
- [ ] 2.4 Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are

### Understandable

- [x] 3.1 Readable: Make text content readable and understandable (added lang attribute)
- [ ] 3.2 Predictable: Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
- [ ] 3.3 Input Assistance: Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### Robust

- [x] 4.1 Compatible: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies (for tested components)

## Testing Strategy

1. **Automated Testing**: Use jest-axe for component-level accessibility testing
2. **Manual Testing**: Perform keyboard navigation and screen reader testing
3. **Visual Inspection**: Check for color contrast and visual accessibility issues
4. **User Testing**: Conduct testing with users who rely on assistive technologies
