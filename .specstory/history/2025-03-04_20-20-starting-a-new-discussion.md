_**Assistant**_

I don't have any previous conversation history with you, so I don't know what we were talking about before. This appears to be the start of our conversation.

Would you like to begin a new discussion about a project or coding task? Based on your custom instructions, I see that you prefer to follow a structured development process that includes:

1. Defining a problem statement
2. Creating a design document
3. Implementing and testing in phases
4. Creating pull requests
5. Following Test-Driven Development
6. Using a systematic error resolution protocol

I'm ready to collaborate with you on whatever project you'd like to work on. Could you share what you'd like to discuss or work on together?
