    // 1. Verify that all interactive elements have a minimum size of 44x44 pixels
    // 2. Check that touch targets have sufficient spacing
    // 3. Ensure that touch feedback is provided (visual or haptic)

  // Note: For more comprehensive touch interaction testing, we would need to:
  // 1. Use a tool like Cypress or Playwright that can actually simulate touch events
  // 2. Test specific touch interactions like swipe, pinch, etc.
  // 3. Verify that touch targets are large enough (at least 44x44 pixels)
  // 4. Test that hover states are handled correctly on touch devices
